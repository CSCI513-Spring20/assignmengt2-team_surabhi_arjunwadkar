Here the ship class is to be observed so it extends the observable and pirate ship which observe the movement of the ship implements the observer. The main class ( OceanExplorer) starts the game, loads the ship, pirate ship, pirate island and island. We used the  random function to generate the co ordinates of ships and islands.  In the method startsailing the ship uses the Ship class to generate and check the next point to move the ship, once the ship is moved and updated in the OceanMap class and then the image is updated in the OceanExplorer class to display.  The Ship class is the observable class so whenever the Christopher Columbus Ship moves setchanged() and notifyobservers() methods are used. In the Pirateship class the update method is invoked whenever the Christopher Columbus Ship moves and move_pirate_ship() method is called to move the pirateship closer to the Christopher Columbus Ship
